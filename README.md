Data from "Environmental Dependence of Type Ia Supernovae in Low-Redshift Galaxy Clusters", https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01088. inner_cluster_data.csv and outer_cluster_data.csv include the SALT3 mB, x1, and c parameter values, distance moduli and Hubble residuals (with 1 referring to Figure 9 and 2 referring to Figure 10), outlier designation from MCMC procedure, host cluster, host cluster redshift (with Hubble diagram version converted to frame of CMB), host cluster r500, projected separation from cluster center, NED Host galaxy name, host or SN redshift used in analysis, and the Host SFR category (Q: quiescent, SF: star-forming, GV: green valley) for our cluster SNe Ia.
sf_field.csv and quiescent_field.csv contain SALT parameter values, distance moduli and Hubble residuals (from Figure 10), host galaxy sSFR and mass measurements, and host redshifts (all spectroscopic, also with Hubble diagram converted values) for SNe Ia in our field samples.
full_cluster.csv contains the data from the table in the appendix of the paper.
